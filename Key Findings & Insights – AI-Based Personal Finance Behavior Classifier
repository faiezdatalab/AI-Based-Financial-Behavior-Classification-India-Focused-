# Key Findings & Insights – AI-Based Personal Finance Behavior Classifier

This document summarizes the major insights, patterns, and business takeaways from our end-to-end classification project that analyzes user financial behavior in an Indian context using synthetic data.

1. Income Level ≠ Better Saving Habits
* High-income users had a higher average savings rate (0.40), but:
* Low and middle-income groups often showed negative or very low savings rates, indicating overspending behavior despite modest earnings.

Takeaway: Financial well-being is not solely dependent on income. Education around financial planning is critical across all income levels.

2. Spending Behavior Varies by City Tier
| City Tier | Saver | Balanced | Over-Spender |
| --------- | ----- | -------- | ------------ |
| Tier-1    | 126   | 39       | 111          |
| Tier-2    | 133   | 53       | 119          |
| Tier-3    | 60    | 22       | 87           |

* Tier-2 cities had the highest count of Savers, while Tier-3 showed higher over-spending, likely due to rising aspirations but limited literacy or resources.

Takeaway: Fintech apps targeting Tier-2 and Tier-3 cities should customize strategies based on spending psychology, not just location.

3. Financial Literacy Has Weak Correlation With Savings Rate
* The correlation between Financial Literacy Score and Savings Rate was just 0.03.
* Surprisingly, users with 60–80 literacy scores had poorer average savings rates than some with lower scores.

Takeaway: Financial awareness alone doesn’t guarantee action. Behavioral nudges and app-based reinforcement might be needed to translate knowledge into action.

4. Dependents Do Not Always Reduce Savings
| Dependents | Avg Savings (INR) |
| ---------- | ----------------- |
| 0          | ₹15,537           |
| 1          | ₹20,543           |
| 2          | ₹18,358           |
| 3          | ₹15,917           |
| 4          | ₹19,812           |

* Surprisingly, users with 1–2 dependents had higher savings on average than those with none or 3+ dependents.

Takeaway: Having dependents may motivate disciplined saving, contrary to assumptions. Personal finance advice should be context-aware.

5. Spending Pattern is Heavily Driven by Savings Rate
Top features influencing behavior: Savings Rate, Total Savings, Income, Income Level (Encoded), Total Expenses
* These factors drove 90%+ of the model's accuracy.
* Model reached 100% accuracy on the test set (synthetic), indicating distinct separability of spender profiles based on financial metrics.

Takeaway: With the right data points, it's possible to automatically classify users and provide tailored nudges/offers based on their behavior type.

6. Over-Spenders Have Higher EMI Loads
| Category     | Avg EMI (₹) |
| ------------ | ----------- |
| Saver        | 13,487      |
| Balanced     | 17,094      |
| Over-Spender | 16,262      |

* Balanced and Over-Spenders had higher EMI obligations, hinting at aggressive borrowing behavior.

Takeaway: EMI monitoring can be used to proactively predict and curb potential overspending patterns using ML models.

#### **Dashboard Added for Deeper Visual Exploration**
* A Tableau dashboard was built to allow users, businesses, and researchers to:
* Interact with filters like city tier, income level, dependents
* Visually assess spending vs saving behavior
* Track EMI trends and financial literacy patterns

#### **Final Thoughts**

This project proves that:
* Behavioral finance + machine learning can segment users meaningfully.
* There's immense potential in applying AI to personal finance apps for tailored insights.
* Strategic design of data collection pipelines, paired with interactive dashboards, can empower both individuals and financial businesses.
